# Stock management app

This application regulates the flow between incoming and outgoing stock of a company's products.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

In addition you need to connect the application to a backend, for this you must add an environment variable with the name `.env.local` and add the content as in the repository example `.env.example`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
